      <p>Happy Valentine's Day! We've been together for 8 months now. I want to be with you for a long, long time, forever.  Seriously.

        But I like to argue with you every day. Even though I might talk rough sometimes, I love you the most. There's never a day that I don't love you. You're the first in so many things in my life. I don't think about or want to meet anyone new. If I had the choice, I'd want to be with you forever. I promise I won't leave you. I'll always be by your side. I'll care for you the way you care for me. I'll make you never be ashamed of being with me.
        
        I've never thought that being with you was a waste of time or a mistake. I'm so incredibly lucky to have met and be with you. I'll make you as lucky as you make me feel. I won't leave you, and you can't leave me either.  Pinky promise!
