      <p>But I like to argue with you every day. Even though I might talk rough sometimes, I love you the most. There's never a day that I don't love you. You're the first in so many things in my life. I don't think about or want to meet anyone new. If I had the choice, I'd want to be with you forever. I promise I won't leave you. I'll always be by your side. I'll care for you the way you care for me. I'll make you never be ashamed of being with me.</p>
      <p>I've never thought that being with you was a waste of time or a mistake. I'm so incredibly lucky to have met and be with you. I'll make you as lucky as you make me feel. I won't leave you, and you can't leave me either. Pinky promise!</p>
